# design-system-figma-scripting

This repo contains all the code developed by the Design System team to create **custom Figma plugins** or build **custom scripts to run in the Figma console** to execute/automate repetive tasks.

## Figma Token

To access the Figma file via REST API is necessary to have [a special authentication token](https://www.figma.com/developers/api#access-tokens). This token is personal, should not be shared or committed to the repo.

To create your personal access token, open Figma and go into *Account > Personal access tokens* and create one for yourself.

Next, add a `.env` file in the `packages/flight/flight-icons` directory, to which you will add the variable:

`FIGMA_TOKEN=###`

where `###` is your personal access token. You can use the `.env.template` file you find in the repository as model, if you want.

**IMPORTANT**: the `.env` file is ignored by git, and should not be committed to the repository.
