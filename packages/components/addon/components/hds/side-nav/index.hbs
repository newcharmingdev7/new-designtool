  ROUGH PLANNING NOTES (these will be deleted, for WIP planning ONLY)

  Component Structure:
  ----------------------------

  * SideNav (parent wrapper component)
    * Header (yielded wrapper component)
      - Logo / Home Button (child) -- we should probably provide
      - Help Dropdown (child) -- should we provide? Perhaps allow users just to add custom links?
      - User Dropdown (child) -- should we provide? Seems like we should

      - Hamburger Button / Close Button -- Need to know more about our planned design
    * Body (yielded wrapper component)
      - NavGroup (1 or more, wrapper/parent component)
        - NavGroup::Header (optional)
        - NavGroup::List
          - ListItem (1 or more)
            - Icon
            - text
            - link (NOTE: Some of the Cloud-Ui ListItems take you to a 2ndary list of links)
            - tag (alpha, beta, etc)
      - User Button -- not sure if we need to include this? (seeing in local CLoud-ui instance)
    * Footer (yielded wrapper component)
      - UserButton ? (opens modal)
      - OrgSelect (Dropdown that opens up)
