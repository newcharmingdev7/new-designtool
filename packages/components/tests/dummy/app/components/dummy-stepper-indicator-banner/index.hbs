  <h3>Stepper Indicator components and a11y concerns</h3>
  <p>At this time the HashiCorp Design System only publishes and supports a Stepper sub-component labelled as an
    <code>Indicator</code>
    which acts as a visual decorator when assembled into larger
    <code>Step</code>
    and
    <code>Task</code>
    patterns.</p>
  <p>
    As is, this component does not conform to the traditional accessibility acceptance criteria as the intention is for
    it to used as a sub-component in a larger pattern which
    <em>does</em>
    have additional accessibility criteria.</p>
