        A

        alert is a rectangular alert (no border-radius). A

        alert typically only has adjacent whitespace to the bottom of it, meaning it's usually flush to the parent
        containing div to its top, left, and right.
      </p>
      <p>
        An
        <code class="dummy-code">inline</code>
        alert is an alert with a border-radius. A
        <code class="dummy-code">page</code>
        alert typically has adjacent whitespace on all four sides.

      <p>
