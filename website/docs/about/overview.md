## What is a design system?

A design system is a set of guidelines, standards, assets, and processes to help organizations rapidly design, build, and deploy products in a consistent manner.

Design systems are commonly equated with a UI kit or component library; in reality an effective design system spans the entire lifecycle of a product through ideation to iteration and everything in between.

### Architecture

While the scale of a design system largely depends on the needs of those consuming it, the fundamental structure and architecture remains largely the same across various systems and is often summarized as a "system of systems" or a collection of overlapping and integrated libraries, processes, and assets.

- **Visual Language System**: colors, typography, icons, imagery, content strategy
- **Component System**: component design, component development, tokens, development standards
- **Documentation System**: education, issue tracking, contribution, content management
- **Interface Design System**: all of the above systems, folded into broader processes and organization

### Why use a design system?

While increasing visual and functional consistency accross products is the most outwardly notable result of design system adoption, the instrinsic value a design system brings can often result in a groundswell of benefits:

- Increased velocity in the design and development of new products and features
- Dismantling of silos between departments that adopt and use the system
- More time spent on solving complex problems, less time spent on duplicative work rebuilding small atoms and molecules
