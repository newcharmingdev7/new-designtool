#### Form::Label

Here is the API for the component:

| Name | Type | Value | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `controlId` | string |  | The ID of the form control associated with the label. This is used to populate the `for` attribute of the `<label>` element. |
| `isRequired` | boolean |  | Appends a `Required` indicator next to the label text when user input is required. |
| `isOptional` | boolean |  | Appends an `Optional` indicator next to the label text when user input is optional. |
| `"yield"` |  |  | Elements passed as children of this component are yielded inside the `<label>` element. |
| `...attributes` |  |  | `...attributes` spreading is supported on this component. |

#### Form::HelperText

Here is the API for the component:

| Name | Type | Value | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `controlId` | string |  | The ID of the form control associated with the helper text. This is used to populate the `id` HTML attribute (with a `helper-text-` prefix) of the element. This HelperText ID can then be referenced in the `aria-describedby` attribute of the form control. |
| `"yield"` |  |  | Elements passed as children of this component are yielded inside the element. |
| `...attributes` |  |  | `...attributes` spreading is supported on this component. |

#### Form::Indicator

Here is the API for the component:

| Name | Type | Value | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `isRequired` | boolean |  | Shows the `Required` indicator. |
| `isOptional` | boolean |  | Shows the `Optional` indicator. |

#### Form::Error

Here is the API for the component:

| Name | Type | Value | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `controlId` | string |  | The ID of the form control associated with the error. This is used to populate the `id` HTML attribute (with an `error-` prefix) of the element. This Error ID can then be referenced in the `aria-describedby` attribute of the form control. |
| `"yield"` |  |  | Elements passed as children of this component are yielded inside the element. |
| `...attributes` |  |  | `...attributes` spreading is supported on this component. |

#### Form::Legend

Here is the API for the component:

| Name | Type | Value | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `isRequired` | boolean |  | Appends a `Required` indicator next to the label text when user input is required. |
| `isOptional` | boolean |  | Appends an `Optional` indicator next to the label text when user input is optional. |
| `"yield"` |  |  | Elements passed as children of this component are yielded inside the `<legend>` element. |
| `...attributes` |  |  | `...attributes` spreading is supported on this component. |

#### Form::Field

Here is the API for the component:

| Name | Type | Value | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `layout` | enum | `vertical` `flag` | Sets the layout of the component. "Vertical" layout is used for `TextInput`, `Textarea` and `Select` fields. "Flag" layout is used for `Checkbox`, `Radio` and `Toggle` fields. |
| `id` | string |  | The control's ID attribute _Notice: by default the ID is automatically generated by the component; use this argument if you need to pass a custom ID for specific reasons you may have._ |
| `extraAriaDescribedBy` | string |  | An extra ID attribute to be added to the `aria-describedby` HTML attribute. _Notice: by default the_ |
| `isRequired` | boolean |  | Appends a `Required` indicator next to the label text when user input is required. |
| `isOptional` | boolean |  | Appends an `Optional` indicator next to the label text when user input is optional. |
| `...attributes` |  |  | `...attributes` spreading is supported on this component. |

##### Contextual components

Control, label, helper text and error content are passed to the field as yielded components, using the `Label`, `HelperText`, `Control`, `Error` keys.

| Name | Type | Value | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `<[F].Label>` | yielded component |  | It is a container that yields its content inside the `<label>` element. The content can be a simple string, or a more complex/structured one (in which case it inherits the text style). For details about its API check the `Form::Label` component. _Notice: the_ |
| `<[F].HelperText>` | yielded component |  | It is a container that yields its content inside the "helper text" block. The content can be a simple string, or a more complex/structured one (in which case it inherits the text style). For details about its API check the `Form::HelperText` component. _Notice: the_ |
| `<[F].Control>` | yielded component |  | It is a very simple container that yields its content. It is used to forward the "base" control inside the "field" control wrapper. The `Control` yielded component exposes two hashed arguments: |
| `<[F].Error>` | yielded component |  | It is a container that yields its content inside the "error" block. The content can be a simple string, or a more complex/structured one (in which case it inherits the text style). For details about its API check the `Form::Error` component. _Notice: the_ |

#### Form::Fieldset

Here is the API for the component:

| Name | Type | Value | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `layout` | enum | `vertical` `horizontal` | Sets the layout of the field controls in the component. |
| `id` | string |  | The fieldset's ID attribute _Notice: by default the ID is automatically generated by the component; use this argument if you need to pass a custom ID for specific reasons you may have._ |
| `isRequired` | boolean |  | Appends a `Required` indicator next to the label text when user input is required. |
| `isOptional` | boolean |  | Appends an `Optional` indicator next to the label text when user input is optional. |
| `...attributes` |  |  | `...attributes` spreading is supported on this component. |

##### Contextual components

Control, label, helper text and error content are passed to the field as yielded components, using the `Label`, `HelperText`, `Control`, `Error` keys. The component exposes also two hashed methods, `id` and `ariaDescribedBy`

| Name | Type | Value | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `<[F].Legend>` | yielded component |  | It is a container that yields its content inside the `<legend>` element. The content can be a simple string, or a more complex/structured one (in which case it inherits the text style). For details about its API check the `Form::Legend` component. |
| `<[F].HelperText>` | yielded component |  | It is a container that yields its content inside the "helper text" block (at group level). The content can be a simple string, or a more complex/structured one (in which case it inherits the text style). For details about its API check the `Form::HelperText` component. _Notice: the_ |
| `<[F].Control>` | yielded component |  | It is a very simple container that yields its content. It is used to forward the "field" control inside the fields' "group" control wrapper. _Notice: you can pass all the controls to a single_ |
| `<[F].Error>` | yielded component |  | It is a container that yields its content inside the "error" block (at group level). The content can be a simple string, or a more complex/structured one (in which case it inherits the text style). |
| `[F].id` | function |  | returns the unique "id" attribute for the control element (generated automatically, unless provided using the `@id` argument described above). |
| `[F].ariaDescribedBy` | function |  | returns the "aria-describedby" attribute for the control element (generated automatically, based on the presence of the `HelperText` an/or the `Error` elements in the field, plus the optional `@extraAriaDescribedBy` argument described above). |
