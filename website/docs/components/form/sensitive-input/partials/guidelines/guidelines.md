### Usage examples


## Sensitive vs Password input

A password field is a specific type of form control designed for secure entry of passwords. The value is always masked or hidden to prevent others from easily reading the entered characters. Unlike the sensitive input, the password field has specific attributes to enhance security and confidentiality of passwords.

The sensitive input is a text field designed to protect sensitive or confidential information while still giving users the ability to show or hide the input value as needed.
