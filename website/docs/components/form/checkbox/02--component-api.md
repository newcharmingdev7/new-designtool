The `Form::Checkbox` component has three different variants, with their own APIs:

*   `Form::Checkbox::Base` - the "basic" component: just the `<input>` control
*   `Form::Checkbox::Field` - the "field" parent component: the `<input>` control, with label, helper text and error messaging (in a wrapping container)
*   `Form::Checkbox::Group` - the "group" parent component: a `<legend>` (optional), a list of fields, and error messaging

| `<[F].Label>` | yielded component |  | It is a container that yields its content inside the `<label>` element. The content can be a simple string, or a more complex/structured one (in which case it inherits the text style). For details about its API check the [undefined](/components/form/base-elements/01_overview/) component. _Notice: the_ |
| `<[F].HelperText>` | yielded component |  | It is a container that yields its content inside the "helper text" block. The content can be a simple string, or a more complex/structured one (in which case it inherits the text style). For details about its API check the [undefined](/components/form/base-elements/01_overview/) component. _Notice: the_ |
| `<[F].Error>` | yielded component |  | It is a container that yields its content inside the "error" block. The content can be a simple string, or a more complex/structured one (in which case it inherits the text style). For details about its API check the [undefined](/components/form/base-elements/01_overview/) component. _Notice: the_ |

##### Contextual components

| `<[G].Legend>` | yielded component |  | It is an (optional) container that yields its content inside the `<legend>` element. The content can be a simple string, or a more complex/structured one (in which case it inherits the text style). For details about its API check the [undefined](/components/form/base-elements/01_overview/) component. |
| `<[G].HelperText>` | yielded component |  | It is a container that yields its content inside the "helper text" block (at group level). The content can be a simple string, or a more complex/structured one (in which case it inherits the text style). For details about its API check the [undefined](/components/form/base-elements/01_overview/) component. _Notice: the_ |
