### Subcomponent anatomy

The subcomponents contained within an Input Group are extensions of Helios form components and therefore have same anatomy as the master components they map to.

## States

The Input Group doesn't have state intrinsically, rather the nested subcomponents maintain their own state as it corresponds with the individual component specifics.
