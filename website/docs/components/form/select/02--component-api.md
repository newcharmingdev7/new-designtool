The `Form::Select` component has two different variants, with their own APIs:

*   `Form::Select::Base` - the "basic" component: just the `<select>` control
*   `Form::Select::Field` - the "field" parent component: the `<select>` control, with label, helper text and error messaging (in a wrapping container)

#### Form::Select::Base

Here is the API for the "base" component:

| Name | Type | Value | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `isInvalid` | boolean |  | It applies an "invalid" appearance to the control (_notice: this does \_not\_ modify its logical validity_). |
| `width` | string |  | _Notice: by default the_ |
| `...attributes` |  |  | `...attributes` spreading is supported on this component. _Notice: the attributes will be applied to the_ _Some examples of HTML attributes that you will likely use:_ |

##### Contextual components

Select's options are passed to the field as yielded components, using the `Options` key.

| Name | Type | Value | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `<[F].Options>` | yielded component |  | It is a container that yields its content inside the `<select>` element. The content needs to be a set of native HTML `<option>` and `<optgroup>` elements (as such, you can provide to them also native HTML attributes). |

#### Form::Select::Field

Here is the API for the "field" component:

| Name | Type | Value | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `isInvalid` | boolean |  | It applies an "invalid" appearance to the control (_notice: this does \_not\_ modify its logical validity_). |
| `width` | string |  | _Notice: by default the_ |
| `id` | string |  | The select control's ID attribute _Notice: by default the ID is automatically generated by the component; use this argument if you need to pass a custom ID for specific reasons you may have._ |
| `isRequired` | boolean |  | Appends a `Required` indicator next to the label text and sets the `required` attribute on the control when user input is required. |
| `isOptional` | boolean |  | Appends an `Optional` indicator next to the label text when user input is optional. |
| `extraAriaDescribedBy` | string |  | An extra ID attribute to be added to the `aria-describedby` HTML attribute. _Notice: by default the_ |
| `...attributes` |  |  | `...attributes` spreading is supported on this component. _Notice: the attributes will be applied to the_ _Some examples of HTML attributes that you will likely use:_ |

##### Contextual components

Options, label, helper text and error content are passed to the field as yielded components, using the `Options`, `Label`, `HelperText`, `Error` keys.

| Name | Type | Value | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `<[F].Options>` | yielded component |  | It is a container that yields its content inside the `<select>` element. The content needs to be a set of native HTML `<option>` and `<optgroup>` elements. |
| `<[F].Label>` | yielded component |  | It is a container that yields its content inside the `<label>` element. The content can be a simple string, or a more complex/structured one (in which case it inherits the text style). For details about its API check the [undefined](/components/form/base-elements/01_overview/) component. _Notice: the_ |
| `<[F].HelperText>` | yielded component |  | It is a container that yields its content inside the "helper text" block. The content can be a simple string, or a more complex/structured one (in which case it inherits the text style). For details about its API check the [undefined](/components/form/base-elements/01_overview/) component. _Notice: the_ |
| `<[F].Error>` | yielded component |  | It is a container that yields its content inside the "error" block.
