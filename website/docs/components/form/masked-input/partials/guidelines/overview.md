A masked input field is a special input that visually obfuscates characters to protect sensitive information by masking them with a circular shape.

!!! Warning

**Important to know**

This component it's meant to be used for **visual obfuscation** only. Consumers should be aware that the hidden text value could still be obtained with other means (eg. copying it from the input, via JavaScript, via the developer tools, etc.).
