## Usage

### When to use

- When a user’s action does not yield any results due to incorrect or incomplete input.
- When an application encounters an issue or error during its operation.

### When not to use

- When the absence of content is expected and does not require an explanation to the user.
- When there is a clear and intuitive way to add or populate content.

## Icon

- The icon should align with the purpose of the content and effectively communicate the same message.

## Actions

- In the footer, you can include up to two stand-alone links. 
- We don’t recommend using buttons, as most actions will navigate the user away from this page. Learn more about [when to use a link vs. a button](https://helios.hashicorp.design/components/link/standalone#usage).
- For the standalone link, we recommend using the medium size.
- Use footer actions to redirect or guide users in solving errors/access issues with actionable steps.

## Content

- The title should be short and provide a clear and concise message.
- Focus on relevant information and avoid unnecessary details.
- Provide a straightforward explanation of the problem or error.
- Include suggestions or guidance for how the user can resolve the issue, if possible.
