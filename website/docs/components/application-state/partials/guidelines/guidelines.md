## Usage

### When to use
- When a user's action does not yield any results due to incorrect or incomplete input.
- When an application encounters an issue or error during its operation.

### When not to use
- When the absence of content is expected and does not require an explanation to the user. 
- When there is a clear and intuitive way to add or populate content. 

## Icon

- The icon should be relevant and communicate the same purpose as the errorCode.

## Actions

- In the footer, you can include two stand-alone links. 
- Itâ€™s important to keep these links separate from call-to-action buttons (CTA), as doing so may cause misalignment with the code.

## Content

- The title should be short of providing a clear and concise message. 
- Focus on relevant information and avoid unnecessary details.
- Provide a straightforward explanation of the problem or error.
- Suggestions or guidance for how the user can resolve the issue, if possible.
