## Size

### Best practices

**Insert image here**

- Use a Flyout size that best accounts for the complexity and detail of the content.
- The **medium** size accounts for the _majority_ of scenarios and is the default recommended size.

## Flyout header

The Flyout header features several properties to better communicate the purpose and content within the component:

### Title icon

- An icon paired with the title can help reinforce the purpose and function of the Flyout while also drawing the eye to the header and title area.
- The coummunication of the purpose of the Flyout should not rely solely on an icon, instead the title should be explicit and pragmatic while the icon provides visual support.
