## States

!!! Info

**A note on disabled states** 

Because disabled states completely remove the interactive function of an element, it can be challenging for a user to understand why it has been disabled and/or why they cannot interact with that element. In an effort to avoid this confusion, we opt for using methods like enabling or hiding the element and, thus, are not offering disabled states for the Dropdown.
