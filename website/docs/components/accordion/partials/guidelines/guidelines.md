## Usage

### When to use

- To reveal content as needed while keeping the UI organized and visually manageable.
- To hide long pieces of content with a similar structure.

### When not to use

- To hide basic non-critical information to users. Instead, consider using a [Reveal](/components/reveal).
- To allow users switch between different content within the same context. Instead, consider using [Tabs](/components/tabs).
