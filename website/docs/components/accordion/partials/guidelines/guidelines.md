## Usage

### When to use

- To show content as needed while keeping the UI organized and visually manageable.
- To hide long pieces of content with a similar structure.

### When not to use

- To hide basic non-critical information to users. Instead, consider using a [Reveal](/components/reveal).
- To allow users switch between different content within the same context. Instead, consider using [Tabs](/components/tabs).

## Content type

The content type property is only relevant within Figma and doesnâ€™t exist as a property within the code.
!!!

The `content` supports any custom content, local components, or Helios components via an `instance swap` property (customInstance) in Figma. In code, `yield` is supported.
