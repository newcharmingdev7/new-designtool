## Usage

### When to use

- To display the primary navigation on a page.

### When not to use

- To move between views within the same context or page, consider [Tabs](#).

## Header

The navigation header displays persistent UI elements that give users quick access to important sections and resources within the application or platform.

### Home link

The home link gives users consistent and quick access to your application's main page or section. Generally, the home or dashboard.

For cloud products, the icon set should always be the HCP service icon. For standalone or open-source products, it should be the product’s service icon (e.g. terraform).
