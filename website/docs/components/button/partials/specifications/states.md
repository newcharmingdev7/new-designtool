![Example of button states](/assets/components/button/button-states.png =722x*)

Disabled buttons should be used sparingly and with intention. Acceptable use cases for disabled buttons include:

- Incomplete flows (e.g., user has not yet completed a required action needed to move forward).
- Permissions restriction.
