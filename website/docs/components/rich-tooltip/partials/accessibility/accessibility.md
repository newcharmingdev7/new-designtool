## Conformance rating


<Doc::Badge @type="warning">Conditionally conformant</Doc::Badge>

On the small and medium heights, the design system itself cannot guarantee that the consumer has left enough space around to meet the minimum height and width requirements of 24x24 px; on its own, the popover trigger does not meet these minimum requirements and users should take care to ensure the correct dimensions are available. Note: if used within a full sentence or paragraph of text, the popover trigger is exempt from this size requirement.
