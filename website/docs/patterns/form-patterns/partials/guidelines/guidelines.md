## Spacing

Spacing between sections, fields, text, and other elements of a form should follow a decreasing scale based off of the 8px grid. This creates a consistent vertical rhythm between elements and reinforces a natural hierarchy and association between elements.

### Form

_Rewrite this_

- A form wraps the content, fields, and actions while simultaneously handling the logic for submitting and action actions performed by the form.
- A form is generally comprised of multiple different sections of varying types.

### Sections

A **section** occupies the largest hierarchy within the form and is used as a descriptive term for organizing content within a form. A section consists of varying combinations of text, form elements (inputs, checkboxes, toggles, etc), and actions. Even in the most simplist of circumstances a form can consist of multiple sections with different content, each receiving a 32px vertical gap in between.
