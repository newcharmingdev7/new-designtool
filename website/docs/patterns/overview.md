## What is a pattern?

A pattern is a combination of components that work together to accomplish a function or render a layout. They are often used to solve the same problem consistently. Common examples of patterns are forms, navigation, button sets, etc.

## HDS pattern support

Patterns are not currently supported by the HashiCorp Design System, but there are future plans to introduce guidelines, documentation, and best practices around assembling HDS components in a consistent and scalable manner.

!!! Info

**Note:**

There are a small number of HDS components that showcase a pattern-like level of complexity ([Modal](/components/modal), [Table](/components/table), [Pagination](/components/pagination)) but are considered components and published as such.
!!!

If you find yourself building the same type of pattern frequently using HDS components, consider [requesting](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScpMXgrUTVT5fYriu4Pp48r4Nl_eCPluVnJLg0Yg3NXsRWvIA/viewform) to add a new pattern to the design system. Don't hesitate to reach out to the design system team for best practices and suggestions when building and defining local components and patterns.
