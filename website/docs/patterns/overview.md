## What is a pattern?

Pattern generally refers to a combination of components which work together to accomplish a function or render a layout and is often used to solve the same problem in a consistent manner. Common examples of patterns are forms, navigation, combinations of action buttons, etc.

> "Components are an interface chunk to be added to an overall layout. whereas patterns may be UI or a variety of other things, like a behavior, flow, application motif or something else." ([Nathan Curtis](https://medium.com/eightshapes-llc/patterns-components-2ce778cbe4e8))

## HDS pattern support

Patterns are not currently supported by the HashiCorp Design System, but there are future plans to introduce guidelines, documentation, and best practices around assembling HDS components in a consistent and scalable manner.

!!! Info

**Note:** There are a small number of HDS components that showcase a pattern-like level of complexity ([Modal](/components/modal), [Table](/components/table), [Pagination](/components/pagination)) but are considered components and published as such.
!!!

If you find yourself building the same type of pattern frequently using HDS components, consider [contributing](/getting-started-contribution) back to the HashiCorp Design System and making your work available to other designers and developers!
