While the alignment, order, and grouping of buttons and actions might seem like a trivial topic, the impact on users is immediate and often occurs in experiences of high important and interruption.

While these guidelines aren't meant to be prescriptive in every scenario, our recommendations are backed up by research and analysis to best serve the user in a consistent manner and understand the impact on the user experience from a holistic perspective.

!!! Info

These guidelines aren't relevant for every component or pattern, but are rather aimed at those that perform specific functions; i.e. a modal, forms, and page-level actions.

## Constrained vs. unconstrained

**Constrained** refers to a component or pattern that is wrapped within a container element, while **unconstrained** refers generally to components that exist at the page level.

- Constrained
    - Dialogs and modals
    - Toolbars
    - Alerts
    - Banners
- Unconstrained
    - General page content
    - In-page forms
    - The "window" in a general sense

This differentiation is important because the expectations from the user are different for each concept. A constrained component or pattern will often be used in an interstitial or circumstantial experience; i.e. an experience that is triggered by either the user or the application illiciting a quick, progressive action.

Unconstrained is generally represented by a more static experience that isn't triggered by a user action and is often tied to a navigational element.

## Layout and reading patterns

When users read content, the pattern their eyes follow generally adheres to one or more reading pattern. By identifying and familiarizing ourselves these patterns we can better understand how the layout within our application, pattern, or component impacts comprehension and interpretation of the content.

The three most common reading patterns are:

- the Gutenberg diagram
- Z-shaped pattern
- F-shaped pattern

### Gutenberg diagram

The Gutenberg diagram refers to a pattern the eyes follow when moving or scanning through **evenly distributed, homogenous content.** This pattern is most relevant in text-heavy scenarios like novels and newspapers/

#### Characteristics

- The users eyes progress through the content on an **axis of orientation** which moves further away from the start edge on each line or break in the content
- Content that falls into the weak fallow area recieves less attention
- This pattern indicates that important content and elements should be placed upon the **reading gravity path**
- This pattern is most prevelant in content with little to no typographic hierarchy (i.e. long-form paragraphs)
- This pattern is considered "in harmony" with natural reading direction and gravity.
