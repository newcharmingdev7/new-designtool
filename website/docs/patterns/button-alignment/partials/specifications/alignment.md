## Alignment

**Alignment** refers to how buttons and actions are aligned relative to the container or page they are used in. Buttons can either be aligned to the left side of the container, or the right. Middle or center alignment is not a viable method for aligning action buttons as the level of complexity within HashiCorp products and the broad share of viewport sizes would cause the button to appear detached from the content or the main page.

!!! Info

When considering internationalization (i18n), **start** and **end** are suitable substitutes for **left** and **right** alignment to account for languages that are read right-to-left ([RTL](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/RTL)).
!!!

Alignment is particular impactful on the user experience when considering reading and layout patterns.
