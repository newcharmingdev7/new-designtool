## Order

When performing an action or function, users generally think from highest to lowest priority and from positive to negative. How buttons and actions are ordered should respect this by ordering the primary (most important) action first, secondary actions second, and if applicable, tertiary actions last.

### Conversational messaging

When considering button order, it's important to keep in mind how users perceive an interaction with an application. Often users communicate with machines and applications as if they were humans, button order can help to reinforce the conversational aspect of working within an application.

Consider the following scenarios:

#### Scenario 1

A user has taken an action to edit the settings of a cluster. Approached with a conversational method, the highest priority positive action (Save changes) comes first, with less-important and negative actions following.

An often depicted alternative to this scenario is to **end** with the most important action as seen in the following comparative examples. When analyzed using one of the aforementioned reading patterns, the example is awkward when read out loud and forces the user to read through items of lower importance first.

- Suboptimal experience: User edits the settings of a cluster
    - "Would you like to delete the cluster?" "No"
    - "Would you like to cancel?" "No"
    - "Would you like to save the changes to this cluster?" "Yes, finally that's what I was trying to do all along."
- Optimal experience: User edits the settings of a cluster
    - "Would you like to save the changes to this cluster?" "Yes, thank you."
