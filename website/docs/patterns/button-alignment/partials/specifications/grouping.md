## Grouping

How actions are grouped can influence what the user perceives as the primary action. Actions grouped correctly can alleviate decision fatigue and help users better understand the outcome of the action they take.

- Group buttons together that perform similar or related functions. This generally refers to inverse functions like "yes/no" or "ok/cancel." 
- Users are generally able to make decisions quicker when they are presented as inverses.
- As a best practice, tertiary actions should only be used if they help the user make a decision (linking to a different area of the application or documentation).
    - Presenting the user with more than one action in this context can be confusing and force the user to question whether they are making the correct decision.
- When combined with consistent **order** and **alignment** methods, conversational nature, priority of actions, reading direction, and layout patterns are collectively reinforced.
