### Permissions 

When a user does not have CRUD (Create, Read, Update and Delete) permissions, hide the related actions.

In this example, the user's role is **viewer** and they cannot **deploy** or **destroy** a cluster. An explanation is not needed as users understand that their account has limited permissions and that they require an additional user's help to gain these permissions (often someone with admin or similar roles).

In scenarios where a user lands on a page they cannot access, provide a reason why with guidance so that users understand what steps they can take to rectify the error. So that users don't feel stuck, provide them a call to action to facilitate a path forward.

### Conditional availability

When a feature or function is conditionally available depending on other steps that must be taken, provide context in place of that action so that users are able to take those steps to enable this feature.

!!! Dont

In this example, the button is disabled and no context is provided, leaving the user confused and unaware of the steps required to enable the feature.

Disabled elements lack interactive states, preventing a user from hovering, focusing, or clicking them. For users with assistive technology (e.g., a screen reader), disabled elements are almost entirely ignored, including the text within.

!!!


!!! Do

Instead, we recommended replacing the disabled element with contextual guidance to help users to understand why this feature isn't available, and providing them with clear steps to enable it.

If possible, provide CTAs directly to the place where users can take immediate action.

### Upgrading

When premium features are available and a user has the necessary permissions, highlighting a path to upgrade provides a graceful marketing opportunity.

An example of this is Figma's "create branch" function that is only available at the enterprise tier. Clicking "create a branch" in Figma opens a marketing modal that entices users to upgrade to gain access to this feature.

### Service outage

In instances where outages may occur, provide a clear message to users on what they can do and add a link to [our status page](https://status.hashicorp.com/).

An example of this is Instagram's login page. When a user has no connection to their servers, a message will appear on submit.

### Incomplete flow

In a form, regardless of whether all of the fields have been filled out, always enable the submit button. When we disable the only way to move forward, users are often left confused and frustrated. Instead, allow users to understand what erorrs took place so that they can fix them and proceed in the form's completion.

In this example, creating a cluster has required inputs. Clicking "create cluster" will display errors where applicable, allowing the user to understand where the problems are to remediate them.

### Quota limitation

When a quota limit has been hit, hide the action and replace it with guidance and a call to action to increase the quota (if possible). If the user does not have permissions to upgrade, direct them to an admin instead.

In this example, there is a limit in creating a new "service." When the limit hasnâ€™t been exceeded, the button is present and functions as normal.

![Image showing a title with a button that allows a user to create a new service, with a table below it.](/assets/patterns/disabled-patterns/create-new-limitation-example.png)

Once the user has reached the maximum number of services, the button is hidden, and a message is placed below indicating why they are no longer able to create a new service.
