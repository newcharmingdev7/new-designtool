Disabling elements should be used sparingly because of accessibility concerns. Non-sighted users will not be able to navigate to or interact with disabled elements rendering them non-existant for assistive technology. Here are some alternative paths one can take:
- Show the content/element as enabled and is interactive.
- Hide the content/element, but show information regarding their limited access.
- Hide the content/element, with no provided context.

This documentation will explain how we approach these decisions and why these alternatives are preferred.
