We recommend avoiding the use of disabled elements. These elements cannot be navigated to or interacted with, making them inaccessible to users who rely on assistive technology. Additionally, user research has validated our recommend approach through user feedback and direct observation.

Instead, we recommend:
- Showing the content/element as enabled and interactive.
- Hiding the content/element but including information explaining their limited access.
- Hiding the content/element entirely with no extra explanation.
