We recommend avoiding disabling elements as they are not accessible to users with assistive technology. Disabled elements cannot be navigated to or interacted with, which can cause confusion and frustration. Additionally, our users have given us explicit feedback that they prefer our approach of not displaying disabled elements in the UI.

Instead, we recommend:
- Show the content/element as enabled and usable.
- Hide the content/element, but show information about their limited access.
- Hide the content/element, but with no provided context.

This documentation will explain how we approach these decisions and why these alternatives are preferred.
