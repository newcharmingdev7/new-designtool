Disabling elements should be used sparingly because of accessibility concerns. Users will not be able to navigate to or interact with disabled elements. Here are some alternative paths that can be taken:
- Show the content/element as enabled and usable.
- Hide the content/element, but show information regarding their limited access.
- Hide the content/element, but with no provided context.

This documentation will explain how we approach these decisions and why these alternatives are preferred.
