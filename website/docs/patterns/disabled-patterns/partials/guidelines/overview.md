We recommend avoiding use of disabled elements. Disabled elements cannot be navigated to or interacted with, making them inaccessible to users who rely on assistive technology. User research and feedback has also validated this recommended approach.

Instead, we recommend:
- Showing the content/element as enabled and interactive.
- Hiding the content/element but including information explaining their limited access.
- Hiding the content/element entirely with no extra explanation.
