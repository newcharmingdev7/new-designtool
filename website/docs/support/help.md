We are happy to provide support to HashiCorp product teams that use our design system.
Here are some of the ways to get help when you get stuck.

## Office Hours

We offer office hours as a way to get feedback on your designs, or help you get unstuck in a code migration.

## Live Support on Slack

Join the #team-design-systems channel in our company Slack chat to ask your questions and get some answers. Since we are a globally-distributed team, there may be a slight delay in answering some questions, but we're usually pretty fast!
