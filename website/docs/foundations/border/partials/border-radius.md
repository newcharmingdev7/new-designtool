## Border radius

Figma doesn't currently support border radius as a style and the HashiCorp Design System doesn't yet publish tokens for border radius. These are a set of high-level guidelines for how border-radius is used in components of various types.

At this time the strategy for applying border radius is determined by the size of the component.

| Size        | Value | Examples                       |
| ----------- | ----- | ------------------------------ |
| Extra small | 3px   | Checkbox                       |
| Small       | 5px   | Badge, Button, Form Components |
| Medium      | 6px   | Card, RadioCard, Alert, Toast  |
| Large       | 8px   | Modal                          |
